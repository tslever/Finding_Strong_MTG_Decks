Please see "Finding_Strong_Decks.html" in the master folder of the "Finding_Strong_MTG_Decks" repository for a pretty presentation of the Jupyter Notebook "Finding_Strong_MTG_Decks.ipynb". This HTML document is a relatively accessible academic-style presenting of my method to determine strong Magic-the-Gathering decks that I can use immediately to play, enjoyably and competively, games in MTG Arena.

The Jupyter Notebook contains executable Python programs used to prepare to develop these strong decks. To access the Jupyter Notebook, I highly recommend downloading "Anaconda Distribution" from "https://www.anaconda.com/". It's a great Python integrated development environment.

I am grateful to:
- EdX.org and the University of California: San Diego for offering a free "Python for Data Science" course geared toward graduate students, which got me started with Python, database manipulation, machine-learning, and natural-language processing.
- Wizards of the Coast for offering a web-based MTG cards database and a gameplay environment that are easy and enjoyable to use.
- MTGArena.pro for offering an extensive community-supported decks database.
- All the contributors to StackOverflow.com for providing solutions and workarounds to conception and implementation difficulties I ran into in writing the Jupyter Notebook.
- The community-oriented (I assume) authors of all the Python modules (including web scraping, database manipulation, and machine-learning modules) that were essential to my work.
- The authors of the approachable and practical "Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit", which provides me food for thought in how to analyze my rules text database more effectively and begin to study natural language processing and artificial intelligence.


Enjoy!
